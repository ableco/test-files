# Test Files
The purpose of this repository is to provide easily accessible files for
common test cases across project teams.

When uploading test files to Filestack and other services, these files, or some
variation of them should be used.

Preceding the filename with `test-` makes it easier to identify whether the file
is necessary for someone looking through existing files.


# Usage

First, clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ableco/test-files.git`.


It's completely up to you how you access the files. A couple of possible options:

1. When you need to access a file for uploading, navigate to the `test-files`
directory and upload one of the files.

2. You can copy the `test-files` directory over to your application for easier
access. This will also allow you to easily add other files specific to your 
project that you want others on the project to have access to.
